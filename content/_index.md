# Social Insight Tools

Welcome to Social Insight Tools, an interactive blog by [markothell](https://x.com/MarkOthell). 

I'm exploring how to understand and visualize human alignment through interactive social spaces that allow groups to see their own collective mind at work.

Each activity takes a social pattern or idea and turns it into an interactive environment that maps the collectiveâ€™s relationships, makes it easy to share insights and can be forked and iterated on by other members of the community. Somewhere in here:

Like twitter polls in that they are user generated, social/interactive and generate data about the group. They are like social experiments in that they generate novel environments, and are structured around a question, hypothesis or intention. They model open source development in that they are designed for reciprocal inquiry, share both data and code and evolve by writing knowledge into code. 

I see the natural conclusion of this work being the creation of an open source social platform for the evolution of culture and communication. For now I have a single activity that I hope will demonstrate what I mean and yield some novel conversations. It allows groups of 2-50(??) to map their collective frames of reference relating to an idea.
