## Discussion

How we relate to other ideologies is a product of what we believe they do and how we think they act on the world. The divisiveness of our central ideologies suggest that these conceptual gaps are quite large (ie. what muslims think Islam does and for whom vs what western materialist scientists think and vice versa).

Maps of culture are like maps of a landscape in that they allow you to preview the terrain and plan the most fortuitous route. I've envisioning a conversation that makes this a mutually beneficial exploration instead of an adverserial one.

Mutually created, living maps have an advantage over externally generated cultural analysis in the way that the process itself transforms the maps. Mutual intention, mutual sharing leads to more aligned language/stratgy which can produce a positive feedback loop of timely and honest sharing. 

This map attempts to get at the core function of an ideology; not what it thinks but how it thinks. What are its embedded assumptions and how does it orient itself to them?
