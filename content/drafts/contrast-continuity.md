If we were to assemble an ideological physics of unification we would need two elements applied recursively to the collective human mind: contrast and continuity. 

In this case unification does not describe homogeneity--one perception, one intention--but the ability to create a conscious, interconnected web of our diverse perceptions and intentions such that we can act as a coherent unit. 

Contrast describes the ability to differentiate between states, beliefs, perceptions--both across the span of humanity as well as within identity groups--a kind of collective introspection. One version of this is just the creation of categories. This feels pretty obvious and is our current cultural default. 

Continuity describes the ability to connect divergent states through a sequence of spannable or actionable steps. These could be a literal sequence of actions like a set of instructions, or, more relevant to this site's intention, it could be a sequence of relationships that connect different parts of the economy (material miner to product end user) or a series of aliancies between interest groups that allow them to coordinate on large scale projects. "Continuity" is the meta skill of stitching together resilient navigable connections across our culture. 

Contast in require for delegation. Continuity is 
Sameness creates safety. Difference inspires action.

They work in tandem because before we can knit together massive complex projects we must divide it into parts.

Together they act as an attention lever that we can move up and down as needed, an infinite zoom knob on the cultural microscope, allowing us to find points of leverage depending on the type of action that is required. 

i say this not because it is a novel discovery in social psychology but in order try and identify a conceptual frame work for the building blocks of social insight tools. I see these two as an abstracted concept for how to create unified collectives. 

Lest we begin to imagine our historical levers of power, using fear to divide and conquer or force articifial aliegance, I will add the qualification that these tools of simplification and introspection must become faculties that the collective possesses *as collectives*. That is, in order that these tools not be able to be used to manipulate us we must learn to weild them deftly for the realization of our own intentions whether at the scale of the individual, family, organization, community, country, or species.
