Emotional Intelligence Quadrants
These four quadrants of emotional intelligence consist of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Understanding and mastering these emotional intelligence quadrants is essential for improving personal and professional situations alike, enhancing one's ability to regulate emotions, improve social interactions, and develop stronger relationships.

Open/Arena (known to self and others)
Hidden/Facade (known to self, unknown to others)
Blind Spot (unknown to self, known to others)
Unknown (unknown to both)

Yale Mood Meter
The Mood Meter is a structured four-quadrant grid designed to assist students in answering an essential question – How are you feeling? Picture a vibrant, color-coded square, neatly divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant, marked by a unique color – cheerful yellow, fiery red, soothing green, and cool blue, represents a distinct group of emotions. Mood Meter-Mastering Emotions with 4-Quadrant SEL Mood Meter

Red: High energy, unpleasant (angry, frustrated)

Co-Occurring Disorders Treatment Matrix
A system called the 4 Quadrant Model that provides a basic framework for matching disorder severity with appropriate treatment. The 4 Quadrant Model – a Co-Occurring Treatment Framework
Maps Mental Health Severity vs. Substance Use Severity to guide treatment approaches for dual-diagnosis situations.
These frameworks are particularly powerful for social-emotional topics because they help people understand the nuanced, multi-dimensional nature of human emotions and relationships. Unlike business matrices that focus on external metrics, these tools illuminate the internal landscape of feelings, attachment patterns, and interpersonal dynamics that shape our most meaningful connections.
