## A social algorithm platform

Social Insight Tools (SIT) is an attempt to describe a cultural learning system comprised of experimental social activities; mini social apps connected by a common framework, evolving through  through open iteration and shared data.

Activities are similar to parts of social media in that they are places for chatting, proposing ideas, surveying community members and listening in on the group’s conversation. A twitter poll is an activity. An online workshop is an activity. 

Each activity can stand alone, a tool communities use to map and coordinate. Or it can be a data point in the broader conversation about which tools and idea spaces are conducting the current of cultural transformation. This is the work of the platform layer. 

The platform layer is a place where users can study the relationships between the many activities and their instances. 

On this layer we attempt to make visible the collected trends within the system and make new more impactful games to play. Instead of jokes, we are trading conceptual lenses that serve the shifting complexities of our social circles, our organizations, our society and seeing which ones take on a life of their own. 

## Cultural Transformation

In a sense this is lowering the bar for scientific experimentation. By making tools of cultural analysis as easy to assemble and interpret as a meme, we create a new sphere of engagement at the intersection of trending ideas, data collection, analysis and collective coordination. 

This is not the data collection required for statistically significant, decision critical assessments at the scale governments need. This is the data collection that allows peers to make meaningful inquiry into each other’s thoughts and beliefs so they can find coherence and take potent action.

We seem to be in a collective identity crisis. Our leaders and institutions stand polarized, caught in a tug of war between diverging aspects of our culture.  We’ve lost the belief that collective systems can be subtle, proportional in their response, and accumulate knowledge through experience. 

In this sense Social Insight Tools describes a practice space. An environment for us to have fun and do good—-on a small scale—-the things we need to succeed at at full scale, in order to flourish as a species. 

*Ideas that spread. Data that facilitates action. Open, mutually governed social community. Means to observe and codify the tools that have the biggest impact so we can scale what works and have fun in the process.*
