title: Games That Matter
Summary: let's play

Our times have revealed new relationships with influence.
Once you had to be son of a noble or in their room of advisors.
Then you captured resources and directed commerce
Now a simple contagious idea can spread around the world in days. 

Facebook changed the world not by convincing people of its importance but because it was fun to swipe right on people. It was fun to be connected a little bit to a lot of people. 

Games:
Sharing useful things. Requires the ability to communicate condensed knowledge. Requires knowing what is useful and to whom.
Identifying convergences.Cultural innovation happens when a turbulent dynamic finds a resonant expression and takes on new life. @defender 

Social survey:
Here's a first game. Think of it as deeper than a twitter poll. It allows deeper participation as it is communally generated. It communicates visual data about the nature of a group. A survey has total anonimity, this is social. This allows you to track the responses of individuals, to see where they fit in the context of the group and to spark conversations based on shared or divergent places on the map.

At full maturity I imagine an algorithm for human prosperity happening at the scale of a social media platform where the metrics of success are owned, and directed by the individual participants. It is an open platform for social experiences where winning patterns can be copied, forked and evolved through the experience of the crowd. 

Think of this like one-off social experiments that 10â€™s or hundreds of people can play with their communities. Collaborative surveys + interactive maps for navigating the resulting social space, with built in visualizations to help you tell the story. 

A solution take insights about cultural progression and turn them into games that allow people to either validate or point out limitations make them part of a platform where these apps can be copied forked evolved as part of a collective learning process. What emerges is systems for lubricating stuck places in our culture and expanding opportunities for joy and creativity here's one example conversations Miss when we have different contacts so here's a tool for mapping the relationships with ideas so that all the members of a group both see the collective set of relationships in a snapshot as well as dial-in to the individual context to extract meaning Focus their interactive efforts and develop tools that serve very specific needs
