title: Open Source Culture
Summary: required

Software wanted to be shared, replicated, modified. In the early days this was easy when it fit on a floppy disk but that meant more complex applications like an operating system were unwieldy and coordinating change became impossible. 

Small business could be run by one mind. Large ones need systems for distributing knowledge and decision making. Logistics of supply chain can't be run by authoritarian rule, commanded what must be done, it is a delicate balance requiring many layers of intertwined feedback loops for a delicate coordinated dance that must be endlessly optimized to adapt to the world. 

We struggle to arrive at coherent values as a culture in part because we are just different (context) but also because we simply can't see enough of the map to know who needs what attention and resources and when. Unlike the supply chain where feedback loops are required we have decided certain areas simply can't respond to subjective human needs. It's each for their own. 

What Git did was break the problem into an inifinite number of small and composible pieces. It allowed creators to make a sandbox for testing a new solution and only add it to the system when it was shown to perform. It allowed developers to track every incremental change (continuity), to test, revert, retoute, etc. It created a database of human problem solving, a generation of minds that knew undeniably the power of humans working cohesively together. 

I'm want to see this light come on for all of humanity. 

Not all cultural challenges can be solved in any moment. Anybody alive today can probably name a few that will not change any time soon. The creators of linux could not have produced Facebook instead. They saw structures that needed building and they went to work. 

My proposal is that we can cultivate a small space on the internet dedicated to exploring the cultural landscape, mapping the relative fluiditiy of our most challenging issues, break them down into little pieces and start building tools that make change effortless, fun even. We need a map for understanding where they fit. So people can begin to connect to them and begin building the infrastructure of human alignment not from authority but as increasingly connected collectives.
