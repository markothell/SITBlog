# Social Insight Tools

Welcome to Social Insight Tools, an experimental blog by markothell.
I'm exploring how we might understand and visualize human alignment through interactive tools. Right now, this is one person, one prototype, and an idea I think is worth pursuing.

### Social algorithms already run our world - we just can't see them
Twitter's algorithm shapes discourse. TikTok's shapes culture. But the most powerful algorithms aren't in machines - they're the invisible patterns that emerge when humans coordinate. I'm building tools to make these patterns visible, shareable, and evolvable.

### Open source culture: fork the workshop, commit the insight
Git(hub) revolutionized software by making code social. What if we could do the same with human coordination? Every transformative experience contains a social algorithm. I want to build the platform where these algorithms can be shared, forked, and improved collectively.

### I built a prototype that maps collective relationship
It's not a survey. It's an interactive tool where groups explore their relationship with ideas - starting with "prosperity." Everyone sees the collective map they create together. The data stays open. The insights stay accessible. [Try it here]

### Gaps in perception are potential energy waiting to be harvested
Every disagreement, every "aha" moment, every shift in group understanding - these are algorithms running in human wetware. Social media platforms extract value from these patterns. I want to create tools that reveal them to us, so we can consciously evolve our culture.

### Power is alignment, and alignment is learnable
When a group achieves "whole body yes" - that rare moment of genuine collective clarity - they're running an alignment algorithm. These moments aren't random. They're replicable. We just need better tools to recognize and scale them.

### This is one person with one tool and a bigger vision
I'm not pretending to be a platform yet. But imagine: facilitators sharing their best processes as forkable templates. Communities A/B testing different approaches to decision-making. Culture evolving through conscious experimentation instead of blind emergence.

### Culture can be a game worth playing together
The tools everybody uses become technology. The patterns everybody follows become culture. I want to make that process visible, participatory, and fun. Starting with this one mapping tool and seeing where it leads.

If this resonates - if you run communities, think about coordination, or just want to play with collective intelligence - try the tool. Tell me what you discover. Help me figure out what to build next.
