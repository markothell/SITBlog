title: 1. Social Algorithms
Summary: We refer to this concept as Social Algorithms because they concern interactions between humans and evolve in concert with the knowledge of the community.

## The AIs will not save us.
As many have found when using AI to write software, LLMs are capable of producing volumes, of code, of solutions, but it is the deft navigator, able to perceive and communicate what is the optimal solution that allows the project to move forward experitiously. 

AI leaders talk about the approach of AGI as if insight into our technological challenges will suddenly unlock unlimited resources and our challenges will go away. But in order to execute of the limitless energy machine we need resources and to get resources we need buy in from humans. When our first second and third (100th) attempts fail we need 

Social algorithms are systems that act as lattice for social structures that could not exist without them. Democracy is one. It helps us to make decisions but it doesn't have any opinions about what is moral, how to invest resources, etc. 

Open source software is a social alogorithm. It sets conditions for how to construct useful things asynchronously, and provides frameworks. Humans have to make all the hard descisions about what is worth building. This is a social challenge because it requires clear communication and coordination of values to arrive at shared purpose. 

Both are made great when individuals have this moment where they switch from the idea that problems are getting solved by someone out there and realize, oh, I can be making things better, and get to woork.

What those tools do is make it seem possible or probable that that effort will have an impact. We can visualize the path because others have walked it. 

Depending on what media you consume it may seem we're at a bit of an impasse as a species. Everybody looking around wondering when they are going to make things make sense again, feeling all the time like the task is myserious and impossible.

If we need new social algorithms we need new ways of arriving at common vision, at articulating complex series of steps through uncharted territory. We need new tools that enhance our ability to perceive needs, coordinate values, and iterate as collective. 

THis site is my attempt to do that.

These tools boost agency in the stickiest areas of our culture by allowing us to see and articulate collective ideas in three crucial ways...
