Social Insight Tools
A blog and experimental space by markothell
Every group that &ldquo;just clicks&rdquo; is running the same program
You know the feeling. The meeting where everything flows. The workshop where strangers become collaborators. The moment when a group suddenly gets it together.
We call it chemistry, emergence, collective intelligence. But what if it&rsquo;s more like electricity - a force that was always there, waiting for us to build the right tools to see it?
I&rsquo;m building tools to decode human coordination
Not personality tests. Not surveys. Interactive spaces where groups can see their own collective mind at work.
My first experiment: a tool that maps how communities think about prosperity. Users nominate ideas, vote on what to explore, then create a living map of their collective relationships. Everyone can explore the data, see the patterns, understand where alignment lives and where creative tension sparks.
[Try the prosperity mapping tool →]
Why this matters: Culture is eating software
We perfected version control for code. We created platforms where millions collaborate on open source projects. We can fork, merge, and evolve software at breathtaking speed.
Meanwhile, our social tools are stuck in the stone age. Surveys that extract data. Polls that flatten nuance. Platforms that feed on engagement instead of understanding.
What if communities could fork each other&rsquo;s decision-making processes? What if the breakthrough your group had last Tuesday could be packaged, shared, and evolved by a thousand other groups? What if culture could iterate as fast as code?
The algorithm is already in you

<p>Social Insight Tools
A blog and experimental space by markothell
Every group that &ldquo;just clicks&rdquo; is running the same program
You know the feeling. The meeting where everything flows. The workshop where strangers become collaborators. The moment when a group suddenly gets it together.
We call it chemistry, emergence, collective intelligence. But what if it&rsquo;s more like electricity - a force that was always there, waiting for us to build the right tools to see it?
I&rsquo;m building tools to decode human coordination
Not personality tests. Not surveys. Interactive spaces where groups can see their own collective mind at work.
My first experiment: a tool that maps how communities think about prosperity. Users nominate ideas, vote on what to explore, then create a living map of their collective relationships. Everyone can explore the data, see the patterns, understand where alignment lives and where creative tension sparks.
[Try the prosperity mapping tool →]
Why this matters: Culture is eating software
We perfected version control for code. We created platforms where millions collaborate on open source projects. We can fork, merge, and evolve software at breathtaking speed.
Meanwhile, our social tools are stuck in the stone age. Surveys that extract data. Polls that flatten nuance. Platforms that feed on engagement instead of understanding.
What if communities could fork each other&rsquo;s decision-making processes? What if the breakthrough your group had last Tuesday could be packaged, shared, and evolved by a thousand other groups? What if culture could iterate as fast as code?
The algorithm is already in you
Watch what happens when a group aligns:</p>
<p>Individual agendas dissolve into shared purpose
Hidden assumptions become visible
&ldquo;My idea&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;our insight&rdquo;
Energy stops being wasted on friction</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t mystical. It&rsquo;s mechanical. There are patterns here, processes that repeat, conditions that catalyze. We just haven&rsquo;t built the instruments to measure and share them.
Here&rsquo;s my bet
The same collective intelligence that created Wikipedia, Linux, and the internet itself can tackle harder problems - if we build the right tools.
Not tools that manipulate or extract. Tools that reveal. Tools that turn the invisible algorithms of human coordination into visible, shareable, evolvable patterns.
Start here
I&rsquo;m one person with one prototype and a hunch that this could become something bigger. If you:</p>
<p>Run communities and want better tools
Think about coordination and collective intelligence
Believe culture could evolve faster
Just want to play with new ways of seeing group dynamics</p>
<p>Then try the tool. Map your community&rsquo;s relationship with prosperity (or fork it for your own topic). Share what you learn. Help me figure out what to build next.
This isn&rsquo;t a platform yet. It&rsquo;s an experiment in making experiments.
