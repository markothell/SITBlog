      <title>Tool: Frame Of Reference Map</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;frame of reference&lt;/strong&gt; is made up of their experiences and the stories they tell about them. It is the private source material that motivates their beliefs about and perceptions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People interpret the world differently. The ability to effectively communicate and coordinate action depends on people&amp;rsquo;s ability to translate across different frames of reference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;rsquo;re going to plan and act collectively, we need ways of holding in view and recursively inspecting the value systems of those involved. Myers-Briggs Type and Enneagram do at least the first of those two but they don&amp;rsquo;t allow people to dynamically dial in or out detail, adapting to the languages of narrow sub-niches and evolving with culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emotional Intelligence Quadrants&#xA;These four quadrants of emotional intelligence consist of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Understanding and mastering these emotional intelligence quadrants is essential for improving personal and professional situations alike, enhancing one&amp;rsquo;s ability to regulate emotions, improve social interactions, and develop stronger relationships. SintellyLinkedIn&#xA;The axes are: Internal vs. External and Recognition vs. Regulation, creating four areas focused on emotional competency.&#xA;Attachment Style Grid&#xA;The upper left section is labeled secure. It is located between low avoidance and low anxiety. Secure attachment is marked by these two things: low relational avoidance and low relational anxiety. LindsaybramanNeurolaunch&#xA;This maps relationships along Attachment Anxiety vs. Attachment Avoidance axes, creating four relationship patterns:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
